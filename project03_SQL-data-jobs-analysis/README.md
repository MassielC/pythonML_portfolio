# SQL Project: Analysis of Data Jobs in 2023 ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project analyzes job postings for **Machine Learning Engineers** and **Data Scientists** in 2023. The goal is to uncover trends in job locations, salaries, required skills, and remote work opportunities (due to I am really interested on both of them and not sure about thw skills I will need to focus on). The analysis is conducted using SQL queries on a dataset of job postings, companies, and skills.

This project is part of my portfolio for **Machine Learning and Data Science** roles, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights from data using SQL. The original dataset was presented ans shared by Luke Barousse on Youtube [(Here his channel)](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse). I am gratefull for his teaching.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of four main tables:
1. **job_postings_fact**: Contains details about job postings, including job titles, locations, salaries, and posting dates.
2. **company_dim**: Provides information about companies posting the jobs.
3. **skills_dim** and
4. **skills_job_dim**: Contain data about skills required for each job.

## Queries and Insights

### Query 1: Top Paying Jobs in Canada and Remote Roles
```sql
(
    SELECT job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short IN ('Machine Learning Engineer', 'Data Scientist')
        AND job_location = 'Canada'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 15
)
UNION ALL
(
    SELECT job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
